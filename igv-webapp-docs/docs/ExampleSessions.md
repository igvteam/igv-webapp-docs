1. Segmented copy number (SEG file) from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples and accompanying sample information. [Open session in IGV-Web.](https://tinyurl.com/2fwhhb6s) 

2. A VCF file of variants and genotypes from 1000 Genomes and accompanying sample information. [Open session in IGV-Web.](https://tinyurl.com/4b2dj6sb)

3. PacBio long-read sequencing data; colored by base modifications (5mC and 6mA). [Open session in IGV-Web.](https://tinyurl.com/2ccd4xc7)

4. Sequencing data of the SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell line and a track indicating translocations. These tracks provide data that are also interesting to view in the Circular Viewer.  Data courtesy of the Schatz lab from *Complex rearrangements and oncogene amplifications revealed by long-read DNA and RNA sequencing of the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line, Nattestad et al. (2017) Genome Research* [doi: 10.1101/gr.231100.117](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.231100.117).
