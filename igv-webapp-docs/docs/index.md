<p class="page-title"> About IGV </p>

The **Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)** is a high-performance, easy-to-use, interactive tool for the visual
exploration of genomic data. It supports flexible integration of all the common types of genomic data and metadata,
investigator-generated or publicly available, loaded from local or cloud sources.

IGV is available in multiple forms, including:

* the original **IGV** - a Java desktop application,
* **IGV-Web** \- a web application,
* **igv.js** \- a JavaScript component that can be embedded in web pages and web apps _(for_ _developers)_

This documentation site is focused on the IGV-Web app. See **[https://igv.org](https://igv.org )** for links to all forms of IGV.

# About IGV-Web

IGV-Web is a web application for exploring genomic datasets. Data can be loaded directly from a user’s local file system, or via URL from web servers and cloud providers. The application runs only in the web browser and no data is ever uploaded to the host site.

IGV-Web is implemented using igv.js, our JavaScript component that allows developers to embed an IGV viewer into web pages and apps. 

The IGV team hosts an instance of IGV-Web at **https://igv.org/app**. To see how to install and configure your own instance of IGV-Web, see the section on [Hosting IGV-Web](Hosting.md).

# IGV website

The general IGV website can be found at [https://igv.org](https://igv.org). 

# Usage license and source code

IGV is completely open for anyone to use under an [MIT open-source license](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/blob/master/license.txt).


The source code repositories for all forms of IGV are hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/igvteam](https://github.com/igvteam). The IGV-Web app repository is hosted at [https://github.com/igvteam/igv-webapp](https://github.com/igvteam/igv-webapp)
